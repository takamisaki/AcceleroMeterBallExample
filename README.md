#  AcceleroMeterBallExample
Practice CMMotionManager and accelerometer, using Objective-C.

# Result

A red ball will hit the ball and rebound with your iOS device action.

# Usage

1. This project is only implemented by Xcode on Mac, so please make sure you have installed Xcode on your Mac.

2. Download the whole zip file and unzip it.

3. Then you can open it and then  **重力小球.xcodeproj** by Xcode and please run it on your iOS device, since there is no AcceleroMeter on Simulator. (I am sorry for this Chinese name, unprofessional, my early project :P)

4. These code has been commentted well. Your idea will be appreciated :D
